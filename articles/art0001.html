                <h1> Abstract </h1>
                <p> Environment temperature plays an important role in influencing consumer purchasing behaviour, especially in seasonal beverages like ice cream. Understanding this relationship allows businesses to optimize sales strategies to maximize revenue. This research aims to apply Linear Regression to predict ice cream sales profit based on environment temperature. A dataset containing temperature and ice cream sales profit was analysed, and a regression model was developed using the Least Squares Method. The model’s performance was evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Coefficient of Determination (R² score) to assess accuracy. The results suggest a strong relationship between environment temperature and sales, with 98.4% of the variations explained, as well as that with each 1℉ increase lead to an about $1.19 rise in sales. The findings strengthens that Linear Regression is an effective tool for predicting sales trends based on temperature variations. </p>
