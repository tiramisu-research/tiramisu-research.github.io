                <h1> Abstract </h1>
                <p> Power creep is a phenomenon in game design where newer content outperforms older content over time. Genshin Impact, a game developed by miHoYo, releases new characters every version or patch, leading to speculation about whether power creep exists in the game. This research aims to determine whether power creep exists in Genshin Impact by analysing the correlation between character release version or patch and tier list rankings using statistical methods. The dataset was compiled from five tier list from five different Genshin Impact guide websites, with rankings standardized. Pearson Correlation and Linear Regression were applied to assess the relationship between release version or patch and character rankings, with additional separate analyses for four-star and five-star characters. The overall analysis showed a moderate correlation (r=0.349). Power creep was primarily observed among five-star characters (r=0.518), while four-star characters showed no such trend. The regression model supported this, indicating that newer five-star characters tend to have higher rankings than older ones. </p>
