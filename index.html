                <p> <b> Editorial Support and Review </b> - To maintain quality, we offer free optional editorial assistance to help refine submissions before publication. While we do not provide a formal peer review process, this service ensures clarity and proper formatting. </p>
                <p> <b> Community Feedback and Revisions </b> - You can update your submissions anytime based on new findings or community feedback. This ensures that the study or work you published remains up-to-date and that you, as an author, have the flexibility to refine your work. </p>
